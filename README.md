# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-SQL-PostgreSQL
This project explores a fictional e-commerce dataset using SQL and PostgreSQL to uncover key business insights. The goal was to simulate a real-world business case where sales, customer behavior, and country performance needed to be analyzed to support data-driven decision-making. The dataset includes order-level details like products, prices, quantities, countries, and order dates across multiple months.

Using structured queries, I extracted valuable metrics, including monthly revenue, top-selling products, customer behavior patterns, and average order value. This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases, write clean SQL, and think analytically from a business perspective.

# Tools Used
PostgreSQL – Used as the relational database to create, populate, and query the e-commerce dataset.

pgAdmin – GUI client for PostgreSQL used to manage tables, run queries, and inspect results.

SQL – Used to analyze the data: aggregations, window functions, filtering, and sorting.

Notepad – Used to save and organize .sql scripts in a clean and reusable format.
